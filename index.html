											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>One of the <strong>major limitations</strong> of user research in automated driving 
											is its <strong>reliance on driving simulations</strong>, which often lack the 
											valuable insights that <strong>real-world driving experiences</strong> can provide. 
											Ayoub et al. analyzed 10 years of AutoUI research and found that 
											conducting studies on automated driving, particularly at 
											SAE Levels 3-5, is challenging due to the limited availability of 
											automated vehicles [1]. As a result, research involving experienced 
											drivers and real-world driving scenarios has been explored only 
											to a limited extent. Similarly, Forster et al. found that 73.29% 
											of the reviewed studies in driving automation were conducted in 
											lab environments, with 71.32% relying on driving simulations [2].</p>
										<p>While simulation-based research methods can yield valid results, 
											studies on the <strong>long-term effects</strong> of<strong> real-world automated driving 
											usage </strong>are scarce. Future research is essential to understand the 
											impact and importance of real-world experience on user experience 
											and usability evaluation of automated driving systems. 
										</p>

										<div class="textbox">
											<p><strong> This year’s AutoUI takes place at the Stanford University 
												in the San Francisco Bay Area — a region at the forefront of automated 
												mobility—it presents the perfect opportunity to explore interactions with 
												existing automated driving systems and to gain insights from users with 
												substantial real-world experience.</strong></p>
										</div>

										<p>In the first phase of our research, we conducted interviews with <strong>10 
											experienced and tech-savvy users</strong> of current automated driving systems, 
											including content creators of popular automated driving YouTube channels. 
											We asked them about their personal experiences with the vehicle 
											interaction, safety-critical situations, communication with other traffic 
											participants, the explainability of the vehicle’s actions, and more. 
											These participants have extensive experience with systems like <strong>Waymo, 
											Cruise, and Tesla FSD</strong>, having completed <strong>hundreds of rides.</strong></p>
										<p>At the <strong>workshop</strong>, we will now <strong>present the findings</strong> from these interviews 
											to the AutoUI community, offering participants a <strong>unique opportunity 
											to engage directly with experienced users</strong> in a Q&A session. Following 
											this, we will conduct <strong>interactive group activities</strong> to identify the most 
											pressing issues that need to be addressed in the coming years, ultimately 
											deriving <strong>concrete research questions to update the AutoUI research 
											agenda.</strong></p>

											<h2>Participation</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The workshop will focus on hearing and discussing the real-world experiences of users, making this 
											the central theme. As such, there will be <b>no paper presentations or submissions.</b> We won’t stick to 
											a specific research topic but will take a <b>holistic look at real-world experiences</b> with Waymo, Cruise, 
											and Tesla FSD technology. A <b>broad range of AutoUI topics will be covered</b>, including trust in the 
											vehicles, interface design, unexpected driving behavior, and communication with other traffic 
											participants etc. </p>
											
										<p>	We welcome participation from researchers at all stages of their careers—whether 
											you're a student, an early-career professional, a seasoned researcher, or an industry expert, your 
											perspective will be a valuable addition to our discussion.</p>

										<p>Our invited experienced users will share their extensive experience with Waymo's Level 4 automated ride-hailing 
											service during the workshop. Waymo currently operates these fully autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, where 
											you can book a ride through their app—no waitlist required. During the workshop, we'll provide all the information 
											you need to take advantage of this incredible opportunity to experience driverless taxis firsthand.
